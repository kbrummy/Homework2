Homework2:

For this homework assignment, I created a portfolio webpage about myself. 
I made an About Me page, a Portfolio page, and a Contact page. 
I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 

I learned that there is a lot more about Bootstrap that I need to learn and work on. My page turned out a little more simple than I had wanted, but I am still happy with the outcome. I believe I completed all the basic requirements for the project.
